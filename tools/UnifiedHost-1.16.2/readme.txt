# INSTALL	Installation instructions
Requires Installation of Java JRE (with JavaFX) or the Java JRE provided with MPLAB X 5.40(or Later)

#Usage:
To Launch from Command Prompt using your system's Java JRE:

> cd \<Harmony3_Path>\bootloader\tools\UnifiedHost-<version>\

> java -Djava.util.logging.config.file="logging.properties" -jar UnifiedHost-<version>.jar

To Launch from Command Prompt using MPLAB X's Java JRE (recommended for Linux):

> cd /<Harmony3_Path>/bootloader/tools/UnifiedHost-<version>/


> /opt/microchip/mplabx/v5.45/sys/java/zulu8.40.0.25-ca-fx-jre8.0.222-linux_x64/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file="logging.properties" -jar UnifiedHost-<version>.jar

replace "v5.45" with MPLAB version.  Verison 5.40+ required
