- Updated the Bootloader host scripts in bootloader/tools to be compatible with Python 3.x

- Moved the Bootloader host scripts compatible with Python 2.7.x to bootloader/tools_archive folder. These scripts may be removed in future.

### Known Issues

The current known issues are as follows:

* Configuration fuse macros are not generated for SAM D09/D10/D11 devices. 

* PIC32MK GPK/GPL/MCM will be supported in the next version of MPLAB X IDE release.

* SAME70 Bootloader application may not work on lower system frequency with high UART Baud-Rate.

* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).
  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead. Help is available in CHM format.
